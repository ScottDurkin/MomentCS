# MomentCS
MomentCS is time manipulation library for .NET Applications. It is packed with tons of preset formatting, timezone calculations and sorting functionality.

```
I am currently working on this NuGet package. as of now there is no functionality.
```

Why did you create this?
```
When I start a new project I have a bundle of different custom .NET libraries I like to use. The main one I always use is my Date And Time one.
Even though .NET has DateTime, I like to use my date & time as integers. So instead of including the same local library all the time, I decided to create it was a NuGet package in case someone else might get use out of it.

I find using integers for date and time makes it easier to create analytic data results within ASP .NET Core, it also reduces the bytes used within the database table which makes loading data faster.
